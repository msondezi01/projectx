	<h1>Greek Mythology</h1>
<p><br>Greek Gods have both the weaker, and stronger gods.</br>

<br>Assuming we use only the Olympians, which means no Hades and sometimes no Demeter, we get

Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Athena, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Poseidon, Hephisitise, Hermes, Demeter/Hestia, and Dyonisis.

Hera, Zeus, Apollo, Hephisitise, and Athena benefit from prep the most, with Apollo and Athena being able to make the most of it.

Physically powerful, we see Poseidon in 3rd- known as the earth shaker, he can move continents, make and break mountains, and causes Earthquakes and Title waves.</br>

<br>Zeus is actually only the 2nd strongest- although his thunderbolt gives him more power over the actual strongest. Zeus solo'd the Typhoon, bested a rebellion led by Athena and Hera after having his thunderbolt stolen from him, and bested his son, Heracles</br>.

<br>Believe it or not, Apollo is the strongest of the Greek gods if not counting Zeus's lightning- Apollo is the only one- god or mortal capable of driving the sun chariot, strong enough to control the horses of the chariot, he's slain a room full of the cyclopes who created Zeus's thunderbolt. Poseidon's trident, and Hades cloak of invisibility. He is the smartest of the gods (Athena is the wisest) has access to the gift of prophecy, which only Hermes also has- and his access is through Apollo. Apollo has solo'd countless beasts since a day after he was born. He was the one responsible for the death of Achilles in the Trojan war by guiding Paris's arrow, and in media/video game representations, one of three gods not killed by Xena, one of two not killed by Krotos (Krotos kills Helios and it is made clear in the series Apollo and Helios are different beings) and when the Roman's "borrowed" Greek religion, is the only god powerful enough to have his Roman counterpart stay the same.</br>

<br>Dyonisis can drive people and gods insane by looking at them a certain way- Apollo is the only god immune to this due to being the god of rationality and sanity as well as so many other things.</br>

<br>Hermes has speed blitz, Zeus's thunderbolt is the most powerful weapon, Apollo and Athena with prep, and Apollo and Artemis's bows- the former being the god of archery and marksmen who not only doesn't miss, but his bow and arrows are unbreakable and can be imbued with the power of the sun.</br>

<br>All Egyptian gods save Ra's later incarnation can be solo'd by Apollo/ Zeus alone.

Finally, Egyptian gods are mortal- Seth butchers Osiris and Ra dies in his first fusion and is reborn as another god. Forgot Hestia/Demeter

 Need to clarify: An Olympian is not counted as one of the strongest/oldest gods- it is defined as those who physically live on Mt. Olympus. Demeter and Hades do not live on Olympus, so they are not counted as Olympians. Hades rules the underworld, Demeter roams the world for 6 months and is on Olympus for 6 months. They are not Olympians.</br>
